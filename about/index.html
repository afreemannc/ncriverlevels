        <h2>Why is this a thing?</h2>
        <p>
Recreational boaters have been getting trashed in record numbers by the local rivers the last few years.
I figure nobody wants to end up getting fished out of the river by EMS so something is out of whack.

Interviews with accident survivors all sound basically the same:
<ul>
  <li /> A group of folks wanted to enjoy a day on the river and were unaware of any potential dangers
  <li /> One or more members of the group ran into trouble with an <a href="/hazards">avoidable hazard</a>
  <li /> The situation escalated when additional members of the group got in trouble trying to help
</ul>

Most of these accidents could have been avoided if folks knew the limitations of their equipment and knew what to avoid.

So I made a website.

        <h2>When do these sorts of accidents occur?</h2>
        <p>
The worst accidents typically happen shortly after a heavy rain. Rivers tend to be less forgiving the higher the water level.
In a lot of cases the folks who got into trouble were paddling a section of river they had been on before and either didn't
realize the river was up or put on anyway and got into trouble.

        <h2>Limitations of their equipment?</h2>
        <p>
Certainly. Recreational kayaks, most sit-on-tops, SUPs, and canoes sold today are designed specifically to be paddled on
lakes or slow moving rivers with no rapids. They can run into problems with manuverability, durability, or safety when
paddled in fast moving water or rapids.

        <h2>What are "recreational craft"? What does "recreational boater" mean?</h2>
        <p>
A recreational craft can be any of the following:
        </p>
<ul>
  <li />Flatwater (or "rec") kayaks designed for use on lakes and ponds.
  <li />Any SUP not specifically designed for use on whitewater.
  <li />Any canoes not specifically designed for use on whitewater.
</ul>
        <p>
A recreational boater is anyone operating one of the craft above, regardless of setting.
