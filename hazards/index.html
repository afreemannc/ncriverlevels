    <h1>River hazards around the Triangle</h1>
    <p>Know before you row!</p>
    <p>
These are some of the most common hazards that have caused accidents (fatal or otherwise) on local rivers. This list is necessarily incomplete as freak weather events, poor judgement leading to bizarre situations, and unavoidable (plain bad luck) accidents have all been known to occur.
    </p>

        <h2>High Water</h2>
        <p>
High water can present a whole host of problems for boaters:
<ul>
  <li />Faster current makes it harder to get your boat to go where you want.
  <li />Large waves can easily flip or swamp a boat.
  <li />Swimming to shore is more difficult and may not be possible.
  <li />Wood and other debris is likely to move. Being chased down the river by a 60' tree is not fun.
  <li />Holes are more likely to hold swimmers underwater.
  <li />If the river is over it's banks all of the bushes and trees on the banks turn into strainers (See Wood). Getting out may not be safe, or even possible.
 </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>How to keep from getting trashed by high water:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li />Check the river level before you go paddling. If the river is up high, don't go.
          <li />After a heavy rain river levels can flash up faster than the river gages can keep up. Gages also ocassionally break or mis-report the level.
Checking levels is no substitute for good judgement. If you get to the river and it looks higher than normal consider paddling somewhere else.
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='hazard'>
        <h2>Wood</h2>
        <p>
Downed trees, exposed root balls, logs, and low hanging branches (called "Strainers") present a lethal hazard on the river and should be avoided at all cost.
They can easily flip a boat if you bump into one and it's very easy to get tangled up in branches and drown.
        </p>
        <h3>How to keep from getting trashed by wood:</h3>
        <ul> 
          <li />Best option: paddle well away from it.
          <li />If it looks like you can't paddle around it get out of the water and walk your boat around it.
        </ul> 
      </div>
      <div class='hazard'>
        <h2>Fast Current</h2>
        <p>
There is no end to the trouble fast moving water can cause. A fast current can easily swamp or flip a boat and shove boaters into places they don't want to go (see Wood). Fast moving water also makes swimming to shore a lot harder and is another leading cause of drowning.
        </p>
        <h3>How to keep from getting trashed by currents:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li />Don't paddle the river when the level is high.
          <li />Avoid paddling sections of river known to have fast moving currents.
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='hazard'>
        <h2>Rocks</h2>
        <p>
Bumping into a rock is an easy way to flip over or get your boat pinned. Some rocks (called undercuts) have caves or tunnels underneath the water that can trap and drown a swimmer.
        </p>
        <h3>How to keep from getting trashed by rocks:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li />Best option: avoid contact if possible.
          <li />If you do hit a rock you may be able to avoid flipping your boat if you lean hard towards the rock.
          <li />If you are swimming do not approach rocks from upstream, swim around them and only approach from downstream.
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='hazard'>
        <h2>Entrapment</h2>
        <p>
Entrapment is any kind of situation involving a boater being trapped underwater, and there are a lot of ways this can happen.
Here are a few of the more common types of entrapment:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li />Tangled in underwater branches (Wood)
          <li />Trapped in boat by sprayskirt
          <li />Foot trapped by debris on the bottom of the river
        </ul>
        <h3>How to keep from getting trashed in an entrapment:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li />Stay well away from any wood in the river
          <li />If you paddle a boat with a sprayskirt practice exiting the craft in a safe setting and make sure the skirt grab loop is outside of the boat when putting your skirt on
          <li />Don't try to stand up in moving water. Keep your feet off the bottom and swim until you can find a still, shallow spot to stand up.
        </ul>
